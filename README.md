# Tetris-Game

### Introduction
Welcome to the classic Tetris game built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game was my final propject in my university's computer graphics course. It offers a challenging and fun experience for players of all skill levels.

### Gameplay
The game keeps track of your score and the number of lines cleared, as well as the current level. As you clear lines, the game's level increases and the block fall speed increases, making it more challenging for the player. To play, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move and rotate the falling blocks. The game is over when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

### Difficulty Progression
As you progress through the game, the difficulty increases after clearing 5 lines. The level increases, and the block fall speed increases, making it harder for the player to keep up. This adds an extra layer of challenge and keeps the game interesting for players who have mastered the basics.
